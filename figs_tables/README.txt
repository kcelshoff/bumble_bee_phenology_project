This folder contains the outputs of code used to generate tables and figures, powerpoint documents used to edit intermediate figures, as well as PNGs of the final images used as figures.

Files in "r_outputs" are the raw figure and csv table outputs from R. Final figures and tables in the other folders were derived from these raw outputs by making small edits in powerpoint and word.

"final_figs" contains the final PNG files of figure images used in the manuscript and Appendix.

"figs_powerpoints" contains the PowerPoint files that were used to edit the raw R outputs of some figures to generate the final figures (adding text, etc.).
