This folder contains all the scripts that were used to run the analyses in this project. They are numbered in the order they should be run, and they should be able to simply be opened (replacing the directory address at the top of the file with whatever you are using on your operating system) and run to reproduce analyses, figures, and tables.

NOTE: when running code that generates standard error values, note that the values you generate will not match the values in the manuscript exactly as they were generated by nonparametric bootstrapping, which is a random process and will thus not generate the same SE estimates each time.

Script 01 downloads and curates the bumble bee occurrence dataset
Script 02 downloads and compiles the climate dataset
Script 03 associates the climate data with the bumble bee occurrences
Script 04 analyzes how bumble bee phenology responds to changes in temperature and precipitation spatiotemporally
Script 05 analyzes whether bumble bee flight periods change in duration in response to longer growing seasons
Script 06 analyzes whether bumble bee reproductive phenology changes in response to longer growing seasons
Script 07 creates precursors to figures and tables used in the final manuscript and appendix.
